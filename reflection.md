# Reflection

## First time creating a complete app from scratch

I had a lot of fun exploring the full journey of application design from start to end. I had worked with skeleton structure to begin projects before, but not a completely blank slate. It was challenging at times to work with AI, although it was helpful in navigating the lack of an existing structure. However, sometimes it created more bugs and struggled to resolve them, even with changes to prompting. I often had to manually debug, which made it useful to have a solid foundation of my concepts and goals for the overall project.

## Importance of good design even with ai to support development. 

AI implementations are very likely to fail without good instruction, but properly defined concepts really helped speed up the development of the application, particularly when doing the front end. Since I defined my concepts independently for event and user interests for example, it became pretty easy to combine them in the front end to get relevant recommendations for users. I also had never developed an AI augmented function prior to this class. It was interesting to play around with the prompts and models, while being careful of the tokens I was utilizing at the same time. 


## Visual aspects

Although my design was minimalistic, the difference in color schemes and fonts I used really contributed to the quality of my front end. Initially the front end scheme that Cursor generated at the start of assignment 4b appeared to be built for mobile development. Despite many attempts to prompt it to fix the error, it was not able to find a solution. The solution was a simple fix regarding the minimum width set for the overall app container of the project. Initially, the color scheme was overwhelmingly sage green, however after feeding cursor my application pitch and asking for a more appropriate design which felt more modern and welcoming, it added a lot more neutral colors. 

##  AI usage

For the backend design, I minimally used AI to ensure that I fully understood my application and properly aligned with the rubric items for modular, independent concepts. I believe that the specific definition of these concepts allowed for a much quicker implementation of the backend with minor fixes. Context was useful for the backend when asking for feedback on my concepts, although it had syntax errors often in the implementation, and sometimes used functions incorrectly when asked to generate tests for concepts. I used AI mostly to generate the front end of my project. It was interesting how quickly Cursor could apply changes, for example when giving it a color palette from coolors. 

## Understanding of concepts

When I first began the project, I was unsure of which concepts I really needed and how to organize them. I was also confused as to how necessary they would be. However, as the project progressed I became very familiar with my concepts as they evolved with my project. The feedback I received on Assignment 2 was extremely helpful, and I also thought it was very useful to discuss with other students in the class with varying projects. I initially designed my concepts to be more in line with features of my project, but I was able to separate them into more independent ideas. As I started working on the front end, it became extremely clear how these concepts interacted with each other without any dependencies, and queries especially augmented the way I could access users and other relevant details for events they should have access to.
