# response:

You are absolutely right. Relying on `await sleep()` in tests makes them slow and, more importantly, *flaky*. Time-dependent logic in tests is notoriously brittle due to system load, scheduling, and imprecise timing.

The core issue here is that the `createEvent` action *requires* `date >= current_time`. This means we cannot create an event with a past date directly to test `completeEvent` without violating `createEvent`'s own preconditions.

The most robust and efficient way to test time-dependent logic without mocking the global `Date` object is to:

1. **Always create events with valid (future) dates** as per `createEvent`'s contract.
2. **Manually modify the `date` field in the database** *before* calling actions like `completeEvent` or `unCancelEvent` that depend on the event's end time relative to `current_time`. This simulates time passing without actually waiting.

Let's refine the `EventConcept` class to include MongoDB indexing for performance and then overhaul the test file with this efficient, deterministic approach.

### Updated Concept Definition for `Event`

No changes to the conceptual specification are needed, as the `duration > 0` precondition was already implied and implemented. The main change in the `EventConcept.ts` file will be adding MongoDB indexes.

**concept** Event \[User]

* **purpose**: enable users to organize and track time-bound occurrences, providing clear and up-to-date information about what, when, and where something will happen

* **principle**: A user can schedule an event by providing essential details such as its name, date, time, location, and description. This information ensures clarity for all involved about the planned occurrence. After the scheduled time, the event naturally transitions to a completed state, automatically reflecting its conclusion. The organizer retains the ability to cancel an event beforehand if plans change, with the flexibility to restore it if circumstances reverse. Organizers may also choose to delete events from the system.

* **state**:
  * a set of Events with
    * an organizer User
    * a name String
    * a date DateTime
    * a duration Number // Duration in minutes
    * a location String
    * a description String
    * a status of "upcoming" or "cancelled" or "completed"

* **actions**:
  * createEvent (organizer: User, name: String, date: DateTime, duration: Number, location: String, description: String): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: date >= current\_time; name != ""; location != ""; description != ""; duration > 0
    * **effects**: creates an event with the given details associated with the organizer, sets the status to "upcoming"; returns the new event

  * modifyEvent (organizer: User, event: Event, newName: String, newDate: DateTime, newDuration: Number, newLocation: String, newDescription: String): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer; newName != ""; newLocation != ""; newDescription != ""; newDate >= current\_time; newDuration > 0; at least one field must differ from the original event details
    * **effects**: event.name := newName, event.date := newDate, event.duration := newDuration, event.location := newLocation, event.description := newDescription; returns event

  * cancelEvent (organizer: User, event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer and event.status = "upcoming"
    * **effects**: event.status := "cancelled"

  * unCancelEvent (organizer: User, event: Event): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer and event.status = "cancelled" and event.date + event.duration >= current\_time
    * **effects**: event.status := "upcoming"; returns event

  * deleteEvent (organizer: User, event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer
    * **effects**: removes event from the set of all existing events

  * **system** completeEvent (event: Event)
    * **requires**: event.status = "upcoming" and (event.date + event.duration <= current\_time)
    * **effects**: event.status := "completed"
