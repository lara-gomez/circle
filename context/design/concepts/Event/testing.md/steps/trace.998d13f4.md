# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `Event` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: An organizer `organizerAlice` who wants to manage events.
2. **Action**: `organizerAlice` schedules a "Team Meeting" event for tomorrow.
   ```
   Event.createEvent({
       organizer: "user:Alice",
       name: "Team Meeting",
       date: "tomorrow", // Example: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
       duration: 60,
       location: "Conference Room A",
       description: "Discuss Q3 strategy"
   })
   ```
3. **Result**: The event is successfully created with an "upcoming" status, and its ID is returned.
   ```
   { event: "event:team-meeting-id" }
   ```
4. **Verification**: The system can retrieve this event, confirming its details and "upcoming" status.
   ```
   Event._getEventById({ event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
   ```
   ```
   // Expected: an array containing the event document
   [ { _id: "event:team-meeting-id", organizer: "user:Alice", name: "Team Meeting", ..., status: "upcoming" } ]
   ```
5. **Action (System)**: (Later) The system detects that a different event, "Past Workshop," has passed its scheduled end time.
   *(For this trace, we assume a "Past Workshop" event was created with `date` and `duration` making it conclude before the current time.)*
   ```
   Event.completeEvent({ event: "event:past-workshop-id" })
   ```
6. **Result**: The "Past Workshop" event's status is automatically transitioned to "completed".
   ```
   {}
   ```
7. **Verification**: The event's status is confirmed as "completed".
   ```
   Event._getEventById({ event: "event:past-workshop-id" })
   ```
   ```
   // Expected: an array containing the updated event document
   [ { _id: "event:past-workshop-id", ..., status: "completed" } ]
   ```
8. **Action**: `organizerAlice` decides to cancel the "Team Meeting" event due to a change in plans.
   ```
   Event.cancelEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
   ```
9. **Result**: The "Team Meeting" event's status is updated to "cancelled".
   ```
   {}
   ```
10. **Verification**: The event's status is confirmed as "cancelled".
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
    ```
    ```
    // Expected: an array containing the updated event document
    [ { _id: "event:team-meeting-id", ..., status: "cancelled" } ]
    ```
11. **Action**: `organizerAlice` reverses the decision and un-cancels the "Team Meeting" event.
    ```
    Event.unCancelEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
    ```
12. **Result**: The "Team Meeting" event's status is restored to "upcoming".
    ```
    { event: "event:team-meeting-id" }
    ```
13. **Verification**: The event's status is confirmed as "upcoming".
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
    ```
    ```
    // Expected: an array containing the updated event document
    [ { _id: "event:team-meeting-id", ..., status: "upcoming" } ]
    ```
14. **Action**: `organizerAlice` later decides to permanently delete the "Team Meeting" event from the system.
    ```
    Event.deleteEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
    ```
15. **Result**: The event is removed from the system.
    ```
    {}
    ```
16. **Verification**: The event can no longer be found, indicating successful deletion.
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:team-meeting-id" })
    ```
    ```
    // Expected: an empty array
    []
    ```
