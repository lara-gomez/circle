# response:

The issues with queries running too long and test failures are likely due to a combination of missing database indexes and imprecise time handling in tests.

Here's a breakdown of the problems and the proposed solutions:

1. **"Queries are running for too long"**:
   * **Cause**: MongoDB queries without appropriate indexes can be slow, especially when filtering on fields like `organizer` or `status`.
   * **Solution**: Add MongoDB indexes to the `organizer` and `status` fields within the `EventConcept` constructor.

2. **Failing `completeEvent` and `unCancelEvent` tests**:
   * **Cause**: The original tests often created events with `date` values already in the past to simulate `completeEvent` scenarios. However, the `createEvent` action's `requires` clause explicitly states `date >= current_time`. This led to a contradiction where the test was asserting success for an action that should have failed based on its own preconditions. Additionally, `sleep` operations need sufficient buffer to account for system scheduling and ensure time-dependent preconditions are met (or correctly failed).
   * **Solution**:
     * Modify the tests to ensure `createEvent` always uses future dates, adhering to its preconditions.
     * When testing `completeEvent` for an event that has passed, create the event in the *future*, then use `sleep` to advance test time past the event's end time before calling `completeEvent`. This accurately simulates a system action taking place *after* the event's scheduled duration.
     * Adjust `sleep` durations with a more generous buffer to prevent flaky tests due to minor timing inaccuracies.
     * Refine the test logic for `unCancelEvent` to correctly distinguish between events that are "upcoming," "cancelled," and "ended," ensuring the right preconditions are met or error messages are asserted.
     * Add `duration > 0` checks to `createEvent` and `modifyEvent` as a reasonable precondition for event durations.

### Updated Concept Definition for `Event` (Minor Precondition Addition)

The concept definition for `Event` will have a minor update to explicitly include `duration > 0` in its action requirements, which was already implemented in the code.

**concept** Event \[User]

* **purpose**: enable users to organize and track time-bound occurrences, providing clear and up-to-date information about what, when, and where something will happen

* **principle**: A user can schedule an event by providing essential details such as its name, date, time, location, and description. This information ensures clarity for all involved about the planned occurrence. After the scheduled time, the event naturally transitions to a completed state, automatically reflecting its conclusion. The organizer retains the ability to cancel an event beforehand if plans change, with the flexibility to restore it if circumstances reverse. Organizers may also choose to delete events from the system.

* **state**:
  * a set of Events with
    * an organizer User
    * a name String
    * a date DateTime
    * a duration Number // Duration in minutes
    * a location String
    * a description String
    * a status of "upcoming" or "cancelled" or "completed"

* **actions**:
  * createEvent (organizer: User, name: String, date: DateTime, duration: Number, location: String, description: String): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: date >= current\_time; name != ""; location != ""; description != ""; duration > 0
    * **effects**: creates an event with the given details associated with the organizer, sets the status to "upcoming"; returns the new event

  * modifyEvent (organizer: User, event: Event, newName: String, newDate: DateTime, newDuration: Number, newLocation: String, newDescription: String): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer; newName != ""; newLocation != ""; newDescription != ""; newDate >= current\_time; newDuration > 0; at least one field must differ from the original event details
    * **effects**: event.name := newName, event.date := newDate, event.duration := newDuration, event.location := newLocation, event.description := newDescription; returns event

  * cancelEvent (organizer: User, event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer and event.status = "upcoming"
    * **effects**: event.status := "cancelled"

  * unCancelEvent (organizer: User, event: Event): (event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer and event.status = "cancelled" and event.date + event.duration >= current\_time
    * **effects**: event.status := "upcoming"; returns event

  * deleteEvent (organizer: User, event: Event)
    * **requires**: organizer = event.organizer
    * **effects**: removes event from the set of all existing events

  * **system** completeEvent (event: Event)
    * **requires**: event.status = "upcoming" and (event.date + event.duration <= current\_time)
    * **effects**: event.status := "completed"
