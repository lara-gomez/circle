# prompt: i am getting this error: Conversion of type 'EventDoc\[]' to type '{ error: string; }' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first. Property 'error' is missing in type 'EventDoc\[]' but required in type '{ error: string; }'.deno-ts(2352) EventConcept.test.ts(607, 43): 'error' is declared here. this is for the query tests
