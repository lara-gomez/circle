# response:

Okay, I will refactor the `EventConcept.test.ts` file to match the flat structure used in `LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts`. This means each distinct test scenario (principle, individual action requirements, queries) will be its own top-level `Deno.test` block, ensuring better isolation and clearer reporting.

I've also incorporated the explicit check for the `modifyEvent` precondition "at least one field must differ from the original event details" as discussed.
