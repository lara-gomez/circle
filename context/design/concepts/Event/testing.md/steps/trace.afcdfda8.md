# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `Event` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: An organizer `organizerAlice`.
2. **Action**: `organizerAlice` schedules an event for a future date.
   ```
   Event.createEvent({
     organizer: "user:Alice",
     name: "Product Launch Meeting",
     date: "<future_datetime_e.g., 2024-10-27T10:00:00.000Z>",
     duration: 90,
     location: "Online (Zoom)",
     description: "Discuss final product launch strategy."
   })
   ```
3. **Result**: A new event is created with status "upcoming", and its ID is returned.
   ```
   { event: "event:id-1" }
   ```
4. **Action (Setup for completion):** To demonstrate automatic completion, a separate event is created that is already in the past.
   ```
   Event.createEvent({
     organizer: "user:Alice",
     name: "Past Training Session",
     date: "<past_datetime_e.g., 2024-01-15T14:00:00.000Z>",
     duration: 60,
     location: "Office Room 3B",
     description: "Annual security training."
   })
   ```
5. **Result (Setup for completion):** A past event is created with status "upcoming" (temporarily).
   ```
   { event: "event:id-2" }
   ```
6. **Action (System):** The system automatically transitions the past event to a completed state as its scheduled time has passed.
   ```
   Event.completeEvent({ event: "event:id-2" })
   ```
7. **Result**: The past event's status is updated to "completed".
   ```
   {} // Event status for "event:id-2" is now "completed"
   ```
8. **Action**: `organizerAlice` decides to cancel the "Product Launch Meeting" (`event:id-1`).
   ```
   Event.cancelEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:id-1" })
   ```
9. **Result**: The event's status is updated to "cancelled".
   ```
   {} // Event status for "event:id-1" is now "cancelled"
   ```
10. **Action**: `organizerAlice` changes their mind and restores the "Product Launch Meeting" (`event:id-1`).
    ```
    Event.unCancelEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:id-1" })
    ```
11. **Result**: The event's status is reverted to "upcoming", and its ID is returned.
    ```
    { event: "event:id-1" } // Event status for "event:id-1" is now "upcoming"
    ```
12. **Action**: `organizerAlice` later decides to permanently delete the "Product Launch Meeting" (`event:id-1`).
    ```
    Event.deleteEvent({ organizer: "user:Alice", event: "event:id-1" })
    ```
13. **Result**: The event is removed from the system. Subsequent queries for `event:id-1` would indicate it's not found.
    ```
    {} // "event:id-1" is no longer in the system
    ```
14. **Verification**: `organizerAlice` queries for their events to confirm the deletion.
    ```
    Event._getEventsByOrganizer({ organizer: "user:Alice" })
    ```
15. **Result**: The list of events organized by Alice now only includes "event:id-2" (the completed past event) but not "event:id-1", confirming its deletion.
    ```
    [
      { _id: "event:id-2", organizer: "user:Alice", name: "Past Training Session", date: "<past_datetime>", duration: 60, location: "Office Room 3B", description: "Annual security training.", status: "completed" }
    ]
    ```
