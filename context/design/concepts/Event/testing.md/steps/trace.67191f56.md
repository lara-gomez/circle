# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `Event` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions, illustrating event creation, modification, system-driven completion, user-driven cancellation and un-cancellation, and ultimately deletion.

1. **Given**: An organizer user `user:Alice`.
2. **Action**: Alice schedules a new event for a future date.
   ```
   const aliceId = "user:Alice" as ID;
   const futureDate = new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 24 hours from now
   futureDate.setHours(10, 0, 0, 0); // For consistency

   Event.createEvent({
     organizer: aliceId,
     name: "Project Sync-up",
     date: futureDate,
     duration: 60, // 1 hour
     location: "Zoom Call",
     description: "Discuss Q4 roadmap",
   })
   ```
3. **Result**: A new event is created, set to "upcoming" status, and its ID is returned.
   ```
   { event: "event:project-sync-up" }
   ```
4. **Action**: Alice realizes she needs to change the time and location.
   ```
   const eventId = "event:project-sync-up" as ID;
   const newFutureDate = new Date(futureDate.getTime() + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 2 hours later
   newFutureDate.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0); // For consistency

   Event.modifyEvent({
     organizer: aliceId,
     event: eventId,
     newName: "Project Sync-up", // Same name
     newDate: newFutureDate,
     newDuration: 75, // Longer duration
     newLocation: "Microsoft Teams",
     newDescription: "Discuss Q4 roadmap and backlog",
   })
   ```
5. **Result**: The event's details are updated in the state.
   ```
   { event: "event:project-sync-up" }
   ```
6. **Query**: Alice checks the event details to confirm the changes.
   ```
   Event._getEventById({ event: "event:project-sync-up" })
   ```
7. **Result**: The fetched event reflects the updated details.
   ```
   [{
     _id: "event:project-sync-up",
     organizer: "user:Alice",
     name: "Project Sync-up",
     date: (newFutureDate object),
     duration: 75,
     location: "Microsoft Teams",
     description: "Discuss Q4 roadmap and backlog",
     status: "upcoming"
   }]
   ```
8. **Setup**: We create a separate event that is already in the past to demonstrate `completeEvent`.
   ```
   const pastDate = new Date(Date.now() - 3 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 3 hours ago
   pastDate.setHours(9, 0, 0, 0); // For consistency

   Event.createEvent({
     organizer: aliceId,
     name: "Old Presentation",
     date: pastDate,
     duration: 30,
     location: "Auditorium",
     description: "Q3 Results Presentation",
   })
   ```
9. **Result**: A new event `event:old-presentation` is created with status "upcoming", but its time has already passed.
   ```
   { event: "event:old-presentation" }
   ```
10. **Action (System)**: The system automatically detects that `event:old-presentation` has ended and completes it.
    ```
    Event.completeEvent({ event: "event:old-presentation" })
    ```
11. **Result**: The event's status is updated to "completed".
    ```
    {}
    ```
12. **Query**: Alice verifies the status of the completed event.
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:old-presentation" })
    ```
13. **Result**: The event shows a "completed" status.
    ```
    [{
      _id: "event:old-presentation",
      // ... other details
      status: "completed"
    }]
    ```
14. **Action**: Alice's plans change, and she decides to cancel the `Project Sync-up` event.
    ```
    Event.cancelEvent({ organizer: aliceId, event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
15. **Result**: The event's status is updated to "cancelled".
    ```
    {}
    ```
16. **Query**: Alice verifies the status of the cancelled event.
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
17. **Result**: The event now shows a "cancelled" status.
    ```
    [{
      _id: "event:project-sync-up",
      // ... other details
      status: "cancelled"
    }]
    ```
18. **Action**: Plans reverse again, and Alice decides to un-cancel the `Project Sync-up` event (since it's still in the future).
    ```
    Event.unCancelEvent({ organizer: aliceId, event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
19. **Result**: The event's status is restored to "upcoming".
    ```
    { event: "event:project-sync-up" }
    ```
20. **Query**: Alice verifies the un-cancelled event's status.
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
21. **Result**: The event is back to "upcoming".
    ```
    [{
      _id: "event:project-sync-up",
      // ... other details
      status: "upcoming"
    }]
    ```
22. **Action**: Alice decides the `Project Sync-up` event is no longer needed at all and deletes it.
    ```
    Event.deleteEvent({ organizer: aliceId, event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
23. **Result**: The event is removed from the system.
    ```
    {}
    ```
24. **Query**: Alice attempts to retrieve the deleted event.
    ```
    Event._getEventById({ event: "event:project-sync-up" })
    ```
25. **Result**: The event cannot be found, confirming its deletion.
    ```
    { error: "Event with ID event:project-sync-up not found." }
    ```
