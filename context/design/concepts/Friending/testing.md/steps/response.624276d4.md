# response:

The issue identified is the direct invocation of a private helper method (`ensureUserExists`) within the test file, which violates the principle of testing only public interfaces and relying on the concept's actions to manage its internal state. The `FriendingConcept`'s public actions (`sendFriendRequest`, `acceptFriendRequest`, `removeFriendRequest`, `removeFriend`) are designed to internally handle the creation of minimal user documents in the concept's state as needed, using `ensureUserExists`. Therefore, the explicit call in the test is redundant and unnecessary.

The corrected test file removes the problematic line, ensuring that all interactions with the `FriendingConcept` are done through its public actions and queries.
