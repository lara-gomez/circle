# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `UserAuthentication` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: A new user, Alice, who wants to register and authenticate.
2. **Action**: Alice attempts to register with a unique username and password.
   ```
   UserAuthentication.register({ username: "alice_jones", password: "securePass123" })
   ```
3. **Result**: The registration is successful. A new `User` entity is created, and its ID is returned to Alice.
   ```
   { user: "user:AliceID123" }
   ```
4. **State Change**: The concept's state now contains a record for `user:AliceID123` with `username: "alice_jones"` and `password: "securePass123"`.
5. **Action**: Alice then attempts to authenticate using the same registered username and password.
   ```
   UserAuthentication.authenticate({ username: "alice_jones", password: "securePass123" })
   ```
6. **Result**: The authentication is successful. The concept verifies the credentials and returns Alice's registered `User` ID.
   ```
   { user: "user:AliceID123" }
   ```
7. **Principle Fulfilled**: Alice has successfully registered and then authenticated using her unique credentials, verifying her identity as the registered user. The system identified her consistently across both operations.
   * (Optional Query for verification after authentication):
     ```
     UserAuthentication._getUsername({ user: "user:AliceID123" })
     ```
     ```
     [{ username: "alice_jones" }]
     ```
