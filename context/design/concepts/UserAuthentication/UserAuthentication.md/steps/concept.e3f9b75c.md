# concept: UserAuthentication \[User]

**concept**: UserAuthentication \[User]

**purpose**: enable users to register and verify their identity using a username and password.

**principle**: If a user registers with a unique username and password, they can then authenticate using those same credentials to be identified as the registered user.

**state**:

```
a set of Users with
  a username String
  a password String
```

**actions**:

```
register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
  requires: the username must not already exist in the system
  effects: create a new User with this username and password, returns the user

authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User) | (error: String)
  requires: there exists a user with the given username and password
  effects: if the username and password match a registered user, returns that user; otherwise returns an error indicating invalid credentials
```

**queries**:

```
_getUsername (user: User) : (username: String)
  requires: user exists
  effects: returns the username associated with the user

_getUserByUsername (username: String) : (user: User) | (error: String)
  requires: a user with the given username exists
  effects: if a user with the given username exists, returns that user; otherwise returns an error
```

### Rationale for Changes:

1. **`loggedIn Flag` Removed from State**: The concept state now focuses purely on the persistent credentials (`username`, `password`) of users. The ephemeral state of a user being "logged in" belongs to a separate `Session` concept.
2. **`login` Renamed to `authenticate`**: This action is now solely responsible for verifying credentials.
   * Its `requires` clause only checks for the existence of matching credentials.
   * Its `effects` clause only returns the `User` ID upon successful verification, or an `error` string for invalid credentials. It no longer manipulates any `loggedIn` status.
3. **`logout` Action Removed**: This action was entirely about managing a user's active session, which is now explicitly delegated to a separate `Session` concept (not defined here, but would be a companion concept).
4. **Updated Principle**: The principle now reflects the core authentication flow, emphasizing identification rather than session state.
5. **Enhanced Query `_getUserByUsername`**: Added an explicit error case to demonstrate the full range of action/query returns.

This revised `UserAuthentication` concept is now more modular, reusable, and independent, adhering better to the "separation of concerns" principle by focusing exclusively on user credential management and verification.
