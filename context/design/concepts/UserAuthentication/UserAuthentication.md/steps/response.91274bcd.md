# response:

Here's the upgraded `UserAuthentication` concept implementation, incorporating proper password hashing and salting using `node:crypto` and adhering to the provided concept design principles and implementation guidelines.

First, let's refine the `concept: UserAuthentication` specification block to explicitly include the `salt` in its state, as this is a crucial part of secure password storage. While the prompt only asked for implementation, aligning the spec is good practice.
