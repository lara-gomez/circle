# problem:

The current implementation of `UserAuthentication` stores user passwords directly as plain strings in the MongoDB database. While this directly follows the `password String` in the provided concept specification for simplicity, it presents a significant security vulnerability in any real-world application. Storing plain passwords makes the system susceptible to data breaches, where an attacker gaining access to the database could immediately compromise all user accounts.
