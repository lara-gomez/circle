# solution:

To address the security vulnerability, the `UserAuthentication` concept's implementation should incorporate password hashing. This involves using a strong, one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm (such as bcrypt) to transform the password into a hash before storing it. During login, the provided password would be hashed and then compared against the stored hash, rather than directly comparing plain text passwords.

This change would affect the `register` and `login` actions:

1. **`register` action**: Before inserting a new user, the `password` argument would be hashed, and the hash would be stored in the database.
2. **`login` action**: When a user attempts to log in, the provided `password` would be hashed, and this newly generated hash would be compared against the stored hash in the database.

The concept specification itself (`password String`) might remain the same at a conceptual level, as `String` denotes a sequence of characters, and the underlying implementation detail of *how* that string is stored securely (as a hash) is abstracted. However, in a more refined specification, one might specify `password HashedString` or `password Hash`.

For the purpose of this exercise, adhering to the given textual spec, the provided TypeScript code does not implement hashing. However, the comments within the code explicitly highlight where hashing should be applied in a production environment. An updated implementation would require adding a password hashing library (e.g., `npm:bcrypt`) and modifying the `register` and `login` methods to utilize it.
