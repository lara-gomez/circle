# i am going to impelement a recommend items here in the actions. make it work so it fits within and can somehow suit a modified version of this operational principle: Recommendations are generated from a pool of events. Events are prioritized by relevance, which is determined according to overlap with a provided set of interests. Filters by location, time, or specific interests are supported. An LLM can take in event characteristics and user interests to produce ranked recommendations.
