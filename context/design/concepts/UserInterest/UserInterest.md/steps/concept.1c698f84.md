# concept: UserInterest \[User, Item]

* **concept**: UserInterest \[User, Item]

* **purpose**: To generate and manage personalized recommendations for users, leveraging their expressed preferences and interactions.

* **principle**: If a user expresses interest in certain categories of items, and later requests recommendations, the concept will provide a ranked list of items tailored to their stated preferences. If the user then interacts with a recommended item (e.g., views or purchases it), subsequent recommendations will adapt to this new behavior.

* **state**:
  * A set of UserItemInterests with
    * a user User
    * an item Item

  * A set of UserPersonalInterests with
    * a user User
    * a tag String

  * A set of GeneratedRecommendations with
    * a user User
    * an item Item
    * a score Number // representing relevance

* **actions**:
  * addPersonalInterest (user: User, tag: String): (personalInterest: UserPersonalInterest)
    * requires: tag is a non-empty String, there does not already exist a UserPersonalInterest associating the user to the given tag
    * effects: creates a UserPersonalInterest associating the user to the tag, and returns it

  * removePersonalInterest (user: User, tag: String)
    * requires: tag is a non-empty string, there exists a UserPersonalInterest associating the user to the given tag
    * effects: removes the UserPersonalInterest associating the user to the tag

  * addItemInterest (user: User, item: Item): (itemInterest: UserItemInterest)
    * requires: there does not already exist a UserItemInterest associating the user to the item
    * effects: creates a UserItemInterest associating the user to the tag, and returns it

  * removeItemInterest (user: User, item: Item)
    * requires: there exists a UserItemInterest associating the user to the given item
    * effects: removes the UserItemInterest associating the user to the item

  * system generateRecommendations (user: User)
    * effects: populates GeneratedRecommendations for the user, potentially replacing or updating old ones based on scores.
