```concept
concept EventRecommendation [User, Event]

*   **purpose**: To provide personalized event recommendations to users by assessing relevance based on explicit user preferences and event characteristics, with the option for AI-driven refinement.
*   **principle**: A user provides their explicit interests, a list of available events, and an optional location filter. The system then evaluates these events against the user's interests, ranking them by relevance. For an enhanced experience, an external AI model can be engaged to analyze a broader context of user preferences and event details, producing a more sophisticated and deeply personalized recommendation list.
*   **state**:
    *   (This concept is stateless; it performs computations on input data and does not manage its own persistent collections.)
*   **actions**: (No state-mutating actions)
*   **queries**:
    *   `_getRecommendedEvents (userId: User, userTags: Set of String, candidateEvents: Set of {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}, filterLocation: String): (event: {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String})`
        *   **requires**: `userId` is a valid user identifier. `candidateEvents` is a non-empty set of events with their details. `filterLocation` is an optional string.
        *   **effects**:
            1.  Filters `candidateEvents` by `filterLocation` if provided.
            2.  Calculates a relevance score for each filtered event based on the overlap between `userTags` and each `event`'s `relevantInterests`.
            3.  Returns an array of event details, sorted by relevance (highest first), then by `date` (earliest first).
            4.  If `candidateEvents` is empty or `userId` is invalid, returns an empty array.
    *   `_getAugmentedRecommendedEvents (userId: User, userTags: Set of String, candidateEvents: Set of {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}, userContext: Map<String, Any>, llmService: Any, filterLocation: String): (event: {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}) | (error: String)`
        *   **requires**: `userId` is a valid user identifier. `candidateEvents` is a non-empty set of events with full details. `llmService` is an operational LLM client/service. `filterLocation` is an optional string.
        *   **effects**:
            1.  Filters `candidateEvents` by `filterLocation` if provided.
            2.  Constructs a detailed prompt for the `llmService` incorporating `userId`, `userTags`, the detailed filtered `candidateEvents`, and the `userContext` map.
            3.  Invokes the `llmService` to analyze and rank the filtered `candidateEvents` based on the provided data.
            4.  If the `llmService` call is successful, returns an array of event details, ranked by the `llmService`.
            5.  If `llmService` fails or is unavailable, or returns invalid results, it falls back to the logic of `_getRecommendedEvents` using the provided inputs, returning the non-augmented ranked events, or an error if that also fails.
