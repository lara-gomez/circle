# Application Pitch

**Application Name:** Circle

Everyone all across the world needs a community to rely on, and what better way is there to do it than through events that match up with your favorite activities? Through Circle, you can easily find personalized events, meet new people, and help your community by leaving ratings and reviews on the quality of events for future upkeep.

On the Discovery Page, you can easily access events recommended based on your interests, hobbies, and past ratings. Mark events as “interested” or “not interested” to improve your recommendations, and bookmark events so planners can gauge interest.

Attend more and more events, and create Circle Connections as you go. Mutually add people as connections and track which events they plan to attend so you can go together!

Keep track of your experiences in the Event History page. When you mark your attendance, leave an anonymous rating and review, which is helpful for both yourself and event organizers who are looking to improve their event quality and turnout. Reflect on which events you enjoyed most and get tailored suggestions for future events.

Get to know your community more through local events, and most importantly, expand your Circle!
