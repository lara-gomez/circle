```concept
concept UserInterest [User, Item]

*   **purpose**: enable users to explicitly declare and manage their interests, both in specific items and in general topics, to personalize their experience, facilitate content discovery, and receive tailored recommendations.
*   **principle**: A user wants to add their personal interests through a specific tag; they can remove this tag or add more tags whenever; they may also indicate interest in specific items and can similarly remove or add more interests in the future. Based on these interests, the system can provide a ranked list of relevant events, optionally enhanced by an AI model for deeper personalization.
*   **state**:
    *   A set of `UserItemInterests` with
        *   a user User
        *   an item Item
    *   A set of `UserPersonalInterests` with
        *   a user User
        *   a tag String
*   **actions**:
    *   `addPersonalInterest (user: User, tag: String): (personalInterest: UserPersonalInterest)`
        *   **requires**: `tag` is a non-empty String, there does not already exist a `UserPersonalInterest` associating the user to the given tag.
        *   **effects**: Creates a `UserPersonalInterest` associating the user to the tag, and returns it.
    *   `removePersonalInterest (user: User, tag: String)`
        *   **requires**: `tag` is a non-empty string, there exists a `UserPersonalInterest` associating the user to the given tag.
        *   **effects**: Removes the `UserPersonalInterest` associating the user to the tag.
    *   `addItemInterest (user: User, item: Item): (itemInterest: UserItemInterest)`
        *   **requires**: There does not already exist a `UserItemInterest` associating the user to the item.
        *   **effects**: Creates a `UserItemInterest` associating the user to the item, and returns it.
    *   `removeItemInterest (user: User, item: Item)`
        *   **requires**: There exists a `UserItemInterest` associating the user to the given item.
        *   **effects**: Removes the `UserItemInterest` associating the user to the item.
*   **queries**:
    *   `_getPersonalInterests (user: User): (tag: String)`
        *   **effects**: Returns all personal interest tags associated with the given user.
    *   `_getItemInterests (user: User): (item: Item)`
        *   **effects**: Returns all item IDs the user is interested in.
    *   `_getRecommendedEvents (userId: User, candidateEvents: Set of {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}, filterLocation: String): (event: {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String})`
        *   **requires**: `userId` is a valid user identifier. `candidateEvents` is a non-empty set of events with their details. `filterLocation` is an optional string.
        *   **effects**:
            1.  Retrieves `userTags` (personal interests) for `userId` from this concept's state.
            2.  Filters `candidateEvents` by `filterLocation` if provided.
            3.  Calculates a relevance score for each filtered event based on the overlap between retrieved `userTags` and each `event`'s `relevantInterests`.
            4.  Returns an array of event details, sorted by relevance (highest first), then by `date` (earliest first).
            5.  If `candidateEvents` is empty or `userId` has no associated personal interests, returns an empty array.
    *   `_getAugmentedRecommendedEvents (userId: User, candidateEvents: Set of {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}, userContext: Map<String, Any>, llmService: Any, filterLocation: String): (event: {id: Event, name: String, date: DateTime, location: String, description: String, relevantInterests: Set of String}) | (error: String)`
        *   **requires**: `userId` is a valid user identifier. `candidateEvents` is a non-empty set of events with full details. `llmService` is an operational LLM client/service. `filterLocation` is an optional string.
        *   **effects**:
            1.  Retrieves `userTags` (personal interests) for `userId` from this concept's state.
            2.  Filters `candidateEvents` by `filterLocation` if provided.
            3.  Constructs a detailed prompt for the `llmService` incorporating `userId`, the retrieved `userTags`, the detailed filtered `candidateEvents`, and the `userContext` map.
            4.  Invokes the `llmService` to analyze and rank the filtered `candidateEvents` based on the provided data.
            5.  If the `llmService` call is successful, returns an array of event details, ranked by the `llmService`.
            6.  If `llmService` fails or is unavailable, or returns invalid results, it falls back to the logic of `_getRecommendedEvents` using the provided inputs and the retrieved `userTags`, returning the non-augmented ranked events, or an error if that also fails.
