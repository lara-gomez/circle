# response:

You're absolutely right to focus on maintaining concept independence and separation of concerns, especially when integrating advanced functionalities like recommendations. The revised `Event` concept specification and its implementation below follow the suggestions: the `Event` concept provides the raw event data and can filter/sort it based on *abstract, externally provided criteria* (JSON strings for filters and priorities), leaving the complex user-interest-to-criteria translation and LLM interaction to other concepts or orchestration logic.

Here are the updated concept specification and its TypeScript implementation for the `Event` concept, including the `_getEventsByRecommendationContext` query. I've also refined the other existing concept implementations (LikertSurvey, Reviewing, Friending, UserAuthentication) to ensure they adhere to the requirements.
