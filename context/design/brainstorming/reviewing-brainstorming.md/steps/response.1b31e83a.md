# response:

The incorrect class-level JSDoc comment is located immediately above the `export default class ReviewingConcept {` declaration:

```typescript
// ... (previous code) ...

/**
 * @concept LikertSurvey   <-- THIS LINE IS INCORRECT
 * @purpose To measure attitudes or opinions by asking respondents to rate their level of agreement with a series of statements on a predefined scale. <-- THIS PURPOSE IS FOR LIKERTSURVEY
 */
export default class ReviewingConcept {
  reviews: Collection<ReviewDoc>;

  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {
    this.reviews = this.db.collection(PREFIX + "reviews");
  }

  // ... (rest of the class) ...
}
```

It should be updated to reflect the `Reviewing` concept's name and purpose as defined in its own specification:

```typescript
/**
 * @concept Reviewing
 * @purpose enable users to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback on items
 */
export default class ReviewingConcept {
  // ...
}
```
