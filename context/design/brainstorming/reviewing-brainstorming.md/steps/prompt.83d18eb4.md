# prompt: i am thinking of modifying review to be a useractivity concept, where users can add reviews and also indicate interest in participating an event. i am narrowing down from my application pitch because it was too ambitious. would it be viable to update the concept to useractivity instead? in addition, can i use a sync for recommendations? or can i use a recommendation action with the generic items in the concept?
