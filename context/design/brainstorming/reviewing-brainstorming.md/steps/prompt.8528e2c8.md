# prompt: does this concept abide by the following point in the assignment: Composite objects. Make sure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB). Composite objects should be used only inside concept implementations and never exposed.
