# prompt: i am going to include a recommend action within my event concept as is, making it generic and applicable to the user since we already have access to all events and event statuses here, would that be bad? i would like to also add the option for users to include their interests in this concept as well. or would the interests belong to the last concept? i only want to implement 5 concepts in total.
