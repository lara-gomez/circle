# prompt: what if i modified the purpose of event to be more in line with providing recommendations? i dont see how recommendation would involve more than just the recommend event action. if the assignment mentions this: Make sure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB), am i not allowed to return a list of recommendations?
